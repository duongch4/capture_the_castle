In Milestone 3, our goals and completed goals were:
- Added 2 new mazes which are picked at random at the start of each new game
- Implemented map loading from external XML files
- Implemented different game states: Game, Help, Menu. Each state has working buttons that either take you to the next
state or activates some functionality (e.g. showing different game instructions, etc)
- Implemented spawning of power ups (bomb and shield). Functionality of each power up was also implemented.
- Inventory items are now shown on the UI
- Setting soldiers within respective player regions. Soldiers are able to move randomly around the player region
- Started fixing the memory leaks. We've made at least a 50% decrease in the memory leaks found.
- Fixed collision problems with the maze walls
- Firework particle system in the win screen to celebrate victory. Particle system travels along a path defined by
a cubic bezier curve
- Bandit AI movement improvements
- Sound effects for buttons and fireworks, as well as new bgm for Help and Menu states.

Discrepancy in Week 5 ~ 6 from project proposal
- Instead of reloadability, we decided to implement complex prescribed motion. When we thought about it the concept
of our game didn't really need saving since there is no true of sense of progress. We don't really have a story line
in our game.
