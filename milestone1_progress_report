In Milestone 1, our goals and completed goals were:
- Set up one hard-coded maze (no good visuals needed yet)
  - we have provided a hard-coded maze and also added in sprites for the tiles with adequate UI implementation.  
- Prepare basic sprites (player-1, player-2, castle, soldiers)
  - player-1, player-2, castle, soldier sprites are completed for both teams (red and blue), plus bandits and some menu ui sprites as well.
- Add Player-1, Player-2, Player movement (on-key)
  - Both Player-1 and Player-2's movement has been implemented and bound to the correct key events
- Research random maze generation
  - Research for random maze generation is ongoing, we have a few possible options we started looking into.
- Wall/Character collision (can use hard-coded maze)
  - Defined movable region on the screen, so the player will not move off the screen.
  - The bandits and both the players are able to detect collision with maze tiles and respond appropriately.
  - But since we currently use simple bounding box collision, we are looking into possible enhancement by switching the player to use circle collision.
- Add Soldiers and their movement (with hard-coded initial position)
  - We have set up the soldier class and are now able to position soldiers in the maze with hard-coded position.

Discrepancy in Week 1 ~ 2 from project proposal
Left to do:
- Define maze regions: No Man's land, Player-1 zone, Player-2 zone.
  - This has not been implemented as we prioritized getting the maze textures. We will instead move this task to Week 3.
- Random maze generation
  - After more research, random maze generation has proven to take significantly more commitment, so we are scheduling it as stretch goal
    and a continuous task throughout the rest of the milestones. 
Did more:
- Implemented Bandit movement and spawning mechanism (originally scheduled in week 5)
- Add sprites to maze (tile sprites) (originally scheduled in week 7)
